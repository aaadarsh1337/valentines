      Well, jokes aside my baby. In these years, you've made me realise smtg very important. Life would be SO empty without you. Like I can't even imagine. So yeah, don't run away pls and always be mine. Happy Valentines Coochie Poochie <33
        P.S. I told you it'd take me 10 mins. I lied. I did this for hours :')) heheh but worth ittttt. I don't want you to waste your study time for reading this ykkk.
